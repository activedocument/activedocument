Setting Field Type as a Class is Deprecated
-------------------------------------------

ActiveDocument has historically supported defining the ``field :type`` option
as either a Symbol or a Class. As of Mongoid 8.0, using a Class is deprecated
and Symbol is preferred. Support for ``field :type`` as a Class will be
removed in a future major version of Mongoid.

.. code-block:: ruby

  class Person
    include Mongoid::Document

    # Deprecated; will log a warning message.
    field :first_name, type: String

    # Good
    field :last_name, type: :string
  end


Support for Defining Custom Field Type Values
---------------------------------------------

Mongoid 8.0 adds the ability to define custom ``field :type`` Symbol values as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

  # in /config/initializers/mongoid_custom_fields.rb

  Mongoid.configure do |config|
    config.field_type :point, Point
  end

Refer to the :ref:`docs <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/fields/#custom-field-types>` for details.
