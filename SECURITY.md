# Security Policy

## Security Patches

Given version scheme `X.Y.Z.P`, ActiveDocument Ultra will release gem security patches all minor versions `Y` of the most recently released two major versions `X`. For example, if the current ActiveDocument Ultra version is `10.1.2.15`, we will release 5 new gems versions for `10.1`, `10.0`, `9.2`, `9.1`, `9.0` (assuming those are the already released major/minor versions.)

Note the first ActiveDocument Ultra release is `9.0.0.0`.
