**‚ö†Ô∏è ActiveDocument is currently in alpha**

ActiveDocument is a Ruby Object Document Mapper (ODM) for NoSQL databases.
It is similar but not identical to what Rails' [ActiveRecord](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/main/activerecord) ORM
provides for SQL databases. ActiveDocument may be used with [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/),
other Ruby frameworks such as [Sinatra](https://sinatrarb.com/) and [Hanami](https://hanamirb.org/), or as a standalone.

### Database support

### Installation

Add to your application's Gemfile. Note that `require: 'active_document'` contains an underscore (while the gem name does not.)

```ruby
gem 'activedocument', git: 'https://github.com/activedocument/activedocument.git', require: 'active_document'
```

### Compatibility

- Ruby
  - Ruby (MRI) 2.7+
  - Rails 6.0+
  - JRuby 9.4+
- MongoDB
  - MongoDB server 5.0+
  - MongoDB driver 2.18+

## OK, show me the code!

### Defining models

- Model fields and relations are defined in your Ruby classes.
- To add new fields or relations, simply add the field definition to your code then release a new version of your app,
  and the field will be included on documents saved thereafter. **No migrations and no `schema.rb` needed!**

```ruby
# /app/models/trainer.rb
class Trainer
  # Include base module into each model class
  include ActiveDocument::Document

  # Define database fields and types
  field :name, type: :string
  field :age,  type: :integer

  # Define relations to other database tables
  belongs_to_many :gyms

  # Models can be nested inside each other
  embeds_many :addresses

  # Can define methods as normal
  def battle(other_trainer)
    # ...
  end
end

# /app/models/gym.rb
class Gym
  include ActiveDocument::Document

  field :name, type: :string

  has_many :trainers

  embeds_many :addresses
end

# /app/models/address.rb
class Address
  include ActiveDocument::Document

  field :city,   type: :string
  field :region, type: :string

  embedded_in :addressable, polymorphic: true
end
```

### Persisting data

- Data can be assigned similarly to ActiveRecord.
- Many-to-many relationships are stored as Arrays of foreign keys in the database. **No join tables needed!**
- You may documents within other documents, which are stored using nested Array and Hash (Map) types in the database.
  Nesting may also be done N-levels deep.

```ruby
gym = Gym.new(name: 'Pewter City Gym')
gym.addresses.build(city: 'Pewter City', region: 'Kanto')
gym.save!

# Document persisted in database "gyms" table:
# {
#   "_id": "664c0c0cd777ae66fec0e8a4",
#   "name": "Pewter City Gym",
#   "addresses": [
#     {
#       "_id": "664c0c0cd777ae66fec0e8a6",
#       "city": "Pewter City",
#       "region": "Kanto"
#     }
#   ]
# }

trainer = Trainer.new(name: 'Ash', age: 10)
trainer.gyms << gym
trainer.addresses.build(city: 'Pallet Town', region: 'Kanto')
trainer.addresses.build(city: 'New Bark Town', region: 'Johto')
trainer.save!

# Document persisted in database "trainers" table:
# {
#   "_id": "664c0c0cd777ae66fec0e8a5",
#   "name": "Ash",
#   "age": 10,
#   "gym_ids": ["664c0c0cd777ae66fec0e8a4"],
#   "addresses": [
#     {
#       "_id": "664c0c0cd777ae66fec0e8a7",
#       "city": "Pallet Town",
#       "region": "Kanto"
#     }, {
#       "_id": "664c0c0cd777ae66fec0e8a8",
#       "city": "New Bark Town",
#       "region": "Johto"
#     }
#   ]
# }
```

### Querying and working with data

- You may retrieve models using chainable query methods similar to ActiveRecord.
- ActiveDocument also exposes the underlying NoSQL database query API where it is possible to do so.

```ruby
ash = Trainer.where(name: 'Ash').first
  #=> #<Trainer name="Ash", age=10>

# Query methods return an instance of `ActiveDocument::Criteria`,
# which is a chainable, lazy-evaluated query builder object.
team_rocket_query = Trainer.any_in(name: ['Jessie', 'James'])
  #=> #<ActiveDocument::Criteria>

team_rocket_query = team_rocket_query.where(age: { '$gt' => 20 })
  #=> #<ActiveDocument::Criteria>

# Call `.to_a`, `.first`, `.each`, `.map`, etc. to execute the query
# and return instance(s) of the model objects.
team_rocket = team_rocket_query.to_a
  #=> [#<Trainer name="Jessie", age=25>, #<Trainer name="James", age=27>]

ash.battle(team_rocket.first)
```

## Documentation

The documentation of this fork will be hosted at: https://activedocument.github.io/activedocument/ (not online yet!)

## Project History

ActiveDocument is a fork of [Mongoid](https://www.github.com/mongodb/mongoid) version 9.0.0.

Mongoid is maintained by MongoDB, Inc. and only supports MongoDB database. ActiveDocument aims to provide
an equally-robust level of support for MongoDB, while also adding support for other NoSQL databases.

## Roadmap

Refer to the [Roadmap issue](https://github.com/activedocument/activedocument/issues/1).

## Releases & Versioning

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** ActiveDocument is currently in `alpha` state. Any releases in the 2.x series should
be considered unstable. The first full release will be `3.0.0`.

- All new releases will undergo battle-testing in production at [TableCheck](https://www.tablecheck.com/en/join/) prior to being released.
- ActiveDocument will target to support new Ruby and Rails versions within 2 months of release.
- Support for new database versions is subject to community contributions. Databases tend to
  maintain a high degree of backwards compatibility.
- ActiveDocument will provide security patches for its 2 most recent major versions.
- ActiveDocument will drop support for end-of-life (EOL) Ruby, Rails, and database versions soon after EOL.

## Support

Support channels are yet to be established for ActiveDocument.

As ActiveDocument is forked from Mongoid, you may find some of the support resources for Mongoid to be useful:

* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mongoid)
* [MongoDB Community Forum](https://developer.mongodb.com/community/forums/tags/c/drivers-odms-connectors/7/mongoid-odm)

## Issues & Contributing

Issues should be raised in the [ActiveDocument Github issue tracker][github-new-issue].

Mongoid since 2013, contributing over 150 PRs to it and related projects. TableCheck uses
ActiveDocument to power millions of restaurant reservations each month, and are
*personally invested* in the making the best developer experience possible.
