**‚ö†Ô∏è ActiveDocument is currently in alpha**

ActiveDocument is a Ruby Object Document Mapper (ODM) for NoSQL databases.
Planned support includes:
- MongoDB
- AWS DynamoDB
- Google Firestore
- CouchDB

## Project History

ActiveDocument is a fork of [Mongoid](https://www.github.com/mongodb/mongoid) version 9.0.0.

Mongoid is maintained by MongoDB, Inc. and only supports MongoDB database. ActiveDocument aims to provide
an equally-robust level of support for MongoDB, while also adding support for other NoSQL databases.

## üì£ Open Call for Community Steering Committee

If you would like to help with governance and/or maintenance of ActiveDocument, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/activedocument/activedocument/issues/new).

## Installation

Add to your application's Gemfile. Note that `require: 'active_document'` contains an underscore (while the gem name does not.)

```ruby
gem 'activedocument', git: 'https://github.com/activedocument/activedocument.git', require: 'active_document'
```

## Compatibility

- Ruby
  - Ruby (MRI) 2.7+
  - Rails 6.0+
  - JRuby 9.4+
- MongoDB
  - MongoDB server 4.4+
  - MongoDB driver 2.18+

## Version Lifecycle

- ActiveDocument will target to support new Ruby and Rails versions within 2 months of release.
- Support for new database versions is subject to community contributions. Databases tend to
  maintain a high degree of backwards compatibility.
- ActiveDocument will provide security patches for its 2 most recent major versions.
- ActiveDocument will drop support for end-of-life (EOL) Ruby, Rails, and database versions soon after EOL.

## Roadmap

- Performance
- Code quality
- Behavior rationality
- Developer experience
- Stability
