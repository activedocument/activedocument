# Mongoid: Ultra Edition

[![Gem Version][rubygems-img]][rubygems-url]üîú
[![License][license-img]][license-url]

The no-baloney fork of Mongoid. Made by the community, for the community.
Mongoid is the Ruby Object Document Mapper (ODM) for MongoDB.

This fork of Mongoid is **not** endorsed by or affiliated with MongoDB Inc. üëç

## üì£ Open Call for Community Steering Committee

If you would like to help with governance and/or maintenance of this project, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/tablecheck/mongoid-ultra/issues/new).

## Installation

Replace `gem 'mongoid'` in your application's Gemfile with:

```ruby
gem 'mongoid-ultra'
```

Do **not** install the `mongoid` and `mongoid-ultra` gems at the same time.
When loading, Mongoid Ultra will raise a `GemConflict` error if
`mongoid` gem is present in your bundle.

## Compatibility

- Rails 6.0+
- Ruby (MRI) 2.7+
- JRuby 9.4+
- MongoDB server 4.4+

Version support may differ from MongoDB Mongoid. We will target to have support for new
Ruby and Rails versions within 1 month of release. As a general policy, Mongoid Ultra will
drop support for end-of-life (EOL) versions soon after EOL. If you are using unsupported EOL
software, please stick with an older version of Mongoid until you upgrade.

## Purpose & Principles

This is a *community-driven fork of Mongoid*, intended to improve the following over MongoDB's Mongoid:

- Performance
- Feature robustness
- Code quality
- Behavior rationality
- Developer experience
- Stability
- Transparency
- Community involvement

This fork will merge in changes at least once-per-month from [mongodb/mongoid](https://github.com/mongodb/mongoid)
as its "upstream" repo. We may backport PRs to upstream where it makes sense to do so, but cannot guarantee that
the upstream will merge them.

## Releases & Versioning

**Important:** Mongoid Ultra is currently in `alpha` state. The first full release will be `9.0.0.0`.

For the time being, version numbers will shadow those of `mongodb/mongoid` with an additional "patch" number added:

`X.Y.Z.P`

Where `X.Y.Z` is the latest upstream release version, and `P` is the patch version of this repo.
`P` will be reset to zero anytime the major version `X` changes, but will not be reset when the minor or tiny `Y`/`Z` version changes.
We will also use `.alpha1`, `.beta1`, `.rc1`, etc. suffixes to denote pre-releases.

**Semver**: For the time being will follow the major version component of semver, i.e. not breaking or
removing functionality *except* in major `X` releases. We may introduce new features in new patch `P` releases,
and will use feature flags prefixed with `ultra_` to allow users to opt-in.

You may distinguish Mongoid Ultra from MongoDB Mongoid by the constant `Mongoid::ULTRA == true`.

All new versions will undergo battle-testing in production at TableCheck prior to being released.

## Roadmap

## Project Governance

Mongoid Ultra is shepherded by the team at TableCheck. TableCheck have been avid Mongoid users since 2013,
contributing over 150 PRs to Mongoid and MongoDB Ruby projects. TableCheck uses Mongoid to power millions of
restaurant reservations each month, and are *personally invested* in the making the best user experience possible.

We invite experienced Mongoid hands in the community to apply for co-maintainership.
Please raise a [Mongoid Ultra Github issue](https://github.com/tablecheck/mongoid-ultra/issues) if interested.

## Reasons for Forking

Mongoid started as an open-source project created by Durran Jordan in 2009. MongoDB Inc. took over maintainership in 2015.
Since the transition, the hallmarks of user-disconnect and corporate fumbling have become apparent:

- Introduction of [critical semver-breaking issues](https://serpapi.com/blog/how-a-routine-gem-update-ended-up-charging/), with [no](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOID-5272) [sign](https://github.com/mongodb/mongoid/pull/5601#issuecomment-1506630267) of [improvement](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOID-5016).
- Lack of a publicly visible roadmap and direction (when requested, it was said to be a "corporate secret".)
- [Unwillingness](https://github.com/mongodb/mongoid/pull/5546#issuecomment-1448910968) to [adopt](https://github.com/mongodb/mongoid/pull/5553#issuecomment-1500361845) [basic](https://github.com/mongodb/bson-ruby/pull/284) industry-standard best practices, e.g. Rubocop linter and a publicly-visible CI workflow.
- Refusal to [merge](https://github.com/mongodb/mongoid/pull/5541#discussion_r1101934994) [patches](https://github.com/mongodb/mongoid/pull/5497) which would be of obvious benefit to the community.
- Lack of bandwidth and resources to review simple PR contributions.

**None of this is intended to disparage the hard-working and talented individuals at MongoDB Inc.**, but rather,
to illustrate that the corporate rules, philosophy, and priorities of MongoDB Inc. are not aligned with the needs
of its Ruby users.

It's time to do better! üí™ We hope this project encourages MongoDB Inc. to improve its own offering.
