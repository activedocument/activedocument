    # of $eq). Unlike $eq this module takes an original operator as an
    # additional argument to +matches?+ to provide the correct exception
    # messages reflecting the operator that was first invoked.

      # Per https://www.mongodb.com/docs/ruby-driver/current/tutorials/bson-v4/#time-instances,

      # are serialized to BSON or Extended JSON, the times are floored to the nearest millisecond.
      #
      # > Because of this flooring, applications are strongly recommended to perform all time
      # calculations using integer math, as inexactness of floating point calculations may produce
      # unexpected results.

      # As such, perform a similar operation to what the bson-ruby gem does.
